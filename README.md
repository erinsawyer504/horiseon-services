# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Horiseon Services - README

I took the current code and applied html and css best practices to it.  I changed many of the divs and gave them more meaningful tags such as nav, header, figure, main, section, aside.  I also combined several of the classes for the sections so that there would be a more condensed CSS code.  I fixed one of the links in the nav list, added a title to the HTML page, changed the headers so they are in sequential order, and added an alt tag to the images for accessibility.
